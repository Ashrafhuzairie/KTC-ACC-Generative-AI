DEFINITIONS \\n2.1. “TBM” (Tunnel Boring Machine) is a machine equipped with excavating \\nmachinery that is i ntegral with the shield and which excavates the full \\ntunnel profile. \\nTBM is a type of pressure balanced machine equipped with a separate \\nchamber behind the cutter head where a mixture of earth and water \\n(Earth Pressure Balance Machine – EPB TBM), slurry (S lurry TBM) or \\na similar medium is pressurised in the excavation chamber to balance \\nthe earth and hydrostatic pressure to be encountered. \\n2.2. “Shield” is a p art of the TBM consisting of protective metal that is \\nforced forward through the ground and which protec ts those working \\nwithin it.  \\n2.3. Tunnel lining can either be constructed using segments (Segmental \\nLining) or monolithic method (Monolithic Lining). Segment al Lining \\nconsists of a number of precast segments bolted or dowelled together, \\nand are installed using a segment erector. Monolithic Lining exists as a \\nsingular piece and does not have any joints. Segmental linings will be \\nerected in the tail of the shiel d within the “tail skin” and the shield will \\nbe forced forward by jacking from the last completed segments. \\n2.4. \"Earth Pressure Balance Machine\" (EPB TBM) is a TBM where the \\nexcavation chamber relies on excavated earth to support the ground. It \\nis equipped with a screw conveyor, belt conveyor and belt weigher. \\n2.5. \"Slurry TBM\" (Slurry TBM) is a TBM which provides fa ce support by \\npressurizing stabilising fluid (slurry counter pressure ) inside the \\nexcavation chamber. Adjustment of slurry counter pressure at the face \\nis dependent on the hydraulic circuit (supply of bentonite slurry,  \\nmucking of slurry and excavated materials). \\n2.6. \"Hydro-Shield TBM\" (Hydro -Shield TBM) is a type of Slurry TBM in \\nwhich the slurry counter  pressure inside the excavation chamber is \\ncompensated by a linked chamber (air -cushion chamber) partially filled \\nwith compressed air and pressurized slurry. \\n2.7. \"Large Diameter TBM\" (Large TBM) refers to any TBM exceeding the \\ncutting diameter of 10m. Large Diameter TBM used for the construction \\nof Single Bored Tunnel is defined as SBT. \\n2.8. \"Rectangular Tunnel Boring Machine\" (RTBM) refers to a TBM with a \\nrectangular excavation profile.  It may or may not be equipped with an \\nearth pressure balancing capability.'),\n",
